Responsive design refers to designing websites in a way that will allow them to look good on screens of all sizes, without elements falling out of place.

## Relative Size Units
Instead of hardcoding pixel sizes, css can define dimensions using relative units. 

### `em`
An `em` represents the `font-size` of the current element (or defined in parent element), defaulting to browser base font-size if none is given.

### `rem`
`rem` stands for *root em*, functioning similarly to `em` but being relative to the `<html>` tag (root element) font-size
