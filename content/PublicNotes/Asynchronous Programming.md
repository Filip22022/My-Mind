**Asynchrony** in programming is occurrence of of events independent of main program flow and ways to deal with such events.

Asynchronous programming is a method allowing a process to run separately from the primary function of the program. It enables multiple processes to run at the same time without waiting for each other to complete.

This method is often used to take care of tasks that may take a longer time to complete without blocking the entire program. The time-consuming task is left to run and the main program continues.
