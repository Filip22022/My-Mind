How to approach the coding interviews and what to do step-by-step

## Before

### Always
- Prepare Self-introduction and final questions

### By setting

#### Virtual
- Prepare pen and paper
- Be in quiet environment with earphones
- Check your setup - internet, webcam, audio
- Prepare environment (coderPad/codePen)

#### Phone
- put the phone down and use earphones
- Check the setup
- request for virtual interview instead, if possible


## During the Interview

### 1. Introduce yourself
Take about a minute

### 2. Understand and clarify the question
1. Paraphrase and repeat the question to the interviewer
2. Clarify assumptions
	- Can you modify the original structure?
	- How is the input/data stored
	- A dictionary of words is a list of strings or a Trie
	- Is the input sorted
3. Clarify inputs
	- what's the range?
	- what's the format?
4. Talk through an example
		come up with simple cases to ensure the understanding and ask if they are in line with interviewer's expectations

### 3. Create and optimize a solution
- Use [[Coding Interview Techniques]]
- Explain different approaches (at a high level) and discuss the trade-offs
- Talk about time/space complexity in big O notation
- Listen to any remarks from the interviewer
- Agree on the best approach and optimize it
- Wait for interviewer signal to start coding

### 4. Code the solution
- Explain what you're doing as you're writing
	- compare different approaches where relevant
- Write working code wherever possible, not pseudocode
- Write clean, simple and correct code
- Use clear names
- Ask for permission to use trivial functions without implementing them
- Write modular code, from high-level to low level
- State where you would do things differently in other circumstances

### 5. Finishing coding
- Scan code for mistakes
- Look for edge cases
- step through edge cases
- Look for possible refactoring
- Reiterate space and time complexity
- Explain trade-offs and how the approach can be improved if given more time

### 6. Ending
- Ask good final questions, tailored to the company
- thank the interviewer

### 7. Later 
- Record the interview questions and answers
- Send a follow up email/LinkedIn invitation to interviewer(s) thanking them for their time and opportunity to interview
