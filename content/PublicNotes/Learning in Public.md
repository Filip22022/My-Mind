# Learning in Public

## What is Learning in Public?

Learning in public is a movement that advocates sharing your your learning with the world, usually through the internet and showing your work and progress instead of waiting for the results.

## Why Should We Do It?

The idea of sharing your work and it's progress before it's ready is intimidating to most, and what does it even give us?

The main benefits of learning in public are:
- Immediate feedback
- Shifting the focus from result to learning
- Combating impostor syndrome


## The Process
When learning in public, instead of sharing only the result and being unable to verify any mistakes along the way, we share the process and can receive feedback on the parts we got wrong. The process of learning something in public can look like this:

- Sharing things you've learned
- Getting into discussions with others and receiving recommendations 
- Learning what resonates with others
- Revising and resharing

## Inspirations

> Of course not everything you do at work is shareable. If the specifics aren’t shareable, the concepts, lessons, and takeaways likely are. While you’re working, keep a scratch pad open and jot down any problems you come across, interesting patterns you see, or things you found confusing. Do this for a month and you’ll have more things to share than you know what to do with!
