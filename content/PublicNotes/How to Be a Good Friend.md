### Be The Friend You want to Have
Instead of saying "I wish I had a fiend who â€¦" start being that friend. Care for your friends and be the person who does all the nice little thins for them.

Don't be afraid of not getting any effort back, if you're showing the example people will give back the energy 

### Keep Track of Your Relationships
Write down the people you want to keep in touch with, and keep the friendships from running on autopilot. You can also write down when you've met those friends.

### Make Notes
Keep a list of topics to talk about, and note any things that they share. They are parts of your connection you can bring up in the future and ideas for future meetups.

### Reach out Casually
Don't be afraid to reach out to give updates on your life, give your best wishes on their birthday or anniversary, send them something interesting or invite them to an activity together.

### Make a Habit of Reaching out
Set aside some time every week to reach out to your friends, make it a habit and put reminders in your calendar if they help

### Be Flexible
Get in touch both in person and online. If their schedule is tight, make yourself available in the little time they could spare
