Data structures are ways of organising data on a computer for easy access and modification. They play a fundamental role in computer science, serving as building blocks for creating algorithms and are the key to solving most coding questions

## Common Data Structures
[[String]]
[[Array]]
[[Matrix]]
[[Hash Table]]
[[Linked List]]
[[Queue]]
[[Stack]]
[[Tree]]

## Linear Vs Non-linear

Linear data structures are ones like arrays or linked lists, where the data is ordered and traversing the structure is sequential also follows the order one way or another.

Non-linear data structures on the other hand don't have to be arranged in any particular order and can be traversed non-sequentially
