An acronym defining the rules for structuring an Angular application, which are as follow (in order of importance)

## Locate
Make locating the code intuitive and fast

Keep related files near each other in an intuitive location, with a descriptive folder structure

## Identify
Name the file such that you instantly know what it contains and represents

Be descriptive with names, and avoid putting multiple components and/or services in one file

## Flat
Keep a flat folder structure for as long as possible

Create a sub-folder when there are more files in a folder (documentation suggests seven)

## T-DRY
Try to be [[DRY Principle|DRY]]

But avoid it when it sacrifices readability
