## In Atomic Habits
> [!Rule] Atomic Habits 2 minute rule
> When building a new habit, it shouldn't take more than 2 minutes

This approach makes new habits easy and not overwhelming. It builds the habit of starting the action, and then continuing is much easier. To improve a habit, you must first have it.

A helpful technique is to break down goals into smaller parts, and starting with the easiest step. For example {writing a book -> writing an article -> writing 1000 words -> writing a paragraph -> writing a sentence}

When you master starting, the first two minutes will become a ritual that put you in the state required for next steps.
On the other hand if you can't get into the habit of starting, you probably won't be able to automate the whole process.

==Don't try to create a perfect habit, start with the basics, then optimize==

### Do only two minutes
Other strategy of using the two minute rule is to restrict the habit to only two minutes, and not a second longer. The point is to strengthen our identity by taking minimal action proving that we're that kind of people. Limiting the habit to not cross the boundary when it feels like working.

When we have the habit down, we can always develop it later.
