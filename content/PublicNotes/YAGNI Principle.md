You Aren't Gonna Need It

This principle advocates to only work on functionalities when they're actually needed, not when we foresee or assume that it's going to be needed in the future.

It helps to achieve a better performance, as it reduces the wasted time, but also stops programmers from implementing suboptimal solutions because of not having all the necessary information.
