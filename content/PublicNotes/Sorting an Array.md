Sorting an array first, before continuing with the rest of the task might make it faster overall, for example by allowing binary search.

Not useful when the order of array elements needs to be preserved
### Time Complexity
Using quicksort is usually O(n * log(n)), while binary search is O(log(n))

## Useful in
[[Merge Intervals]]
[[Non-Overlapping Intervals]]
