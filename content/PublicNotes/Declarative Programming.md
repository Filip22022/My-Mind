Declarative programming is a [[Programming Paradigm]] where the code describes what the program should do / what are the expected effects without explicitly specifying it's [[Control Flow]] explicitly.

This style aims to minimize side effects by describing what the program should accomplish, and leaving how to accomplish it up to the languages implementation which creates less unknowns and instability. 

## Declarative Paradigms

- Constraint Programming
- Functional Programming
- Logic Programming
- Mathematical Modeling
