## My Ideas

### Remember My Goals
Have notes or images with the goal and it's benefits to remind myself of the reason I'm doing things

### Visualize the progress 
Create trackers and progress bars, make it easy to see what to do, how much, and where that leads

### Use the aesthetic
Change the outfit, create a different environment, look at Pinterest board. Use the positive associations and cool aesthetics to get into the mood.

### Get Motivational Media
Watch videos of people who do what I want to do, draw scenes I want to be in, listen to music that brings my goals to mind, look at pictures that make me want to do more



## How to Stay Motivated - Found Tips

### Create a Plan
Making a easy to follow plan keeps you updated on how much progress you're making and how close you are to the goals and rewards

### Set Achievable Goals
It's important to have a real and achievable goal, towards which you can measure progress.
If a goal is big, it should have sub-goals which are achievable in a smaller scope.

### Reward Yourself
Set up rewards for successes. Be careful - the rewards shouldn't contradict the goals.
The best rewards are uncertain, we don't know what we get or when we achieve it.

### Loss Aversion
Avoiding loss is even more motivating than seeking gain. You can set up possible losses to stay motivated.

### Limit the Middle
People are more motivated at the begging and end of a task. If you make the task shorter, you limit the problematic middle part.

### Switch Perspective
Look at the first 50% in a "how much I did" fashion, and at the remaining 50% in a "how much I have left" fashion.

## Thoughts
- Always try to take two steps forward one step back, not the other way around. Change is not a linear process
