Habit Stacking is a special form of [[Implementation Intention]], binding the habit to an existing habit instead of time and place. This allows us to use the already strong habits to make the new ones easy to remember.

## Formula
In essence habit stacking is just doing the new habit before/after an old one:
=="After/Before {Current Habit}, I will {New Habit} ==

>[!Important] When choosing an existing habit to bid to, pay attention to it's circumstances, so that time and place are appropriate for the new habit
