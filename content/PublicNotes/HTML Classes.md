The `class` in html is an attribute which can be used on any element, multiple elements can share a class, and multiple classes can be applied to one element. The attribute is often used to accurately target an element or a group of elements from a [[CSS]] stylesheet or [[JavaScript]] code.

Multiple classes on an element are separated by a space: `class="class1 class2"` would apply both class `class1` and `class2` not one class `class1 class2`
### Example
```html
<h1 class="bold uppercase">Heading</h1>
<p class="uppercase">Paragraph</p>
```
