# Dnd House Rules

## General

### Rolls
- Emphasis Roll - used for situations where it can go very good or very bad
	- Roll 2d20 and take the result which is further from 10

### Inspiration
- Each player get's a token face down - when they think someone did something really cool or inspiration-worthy they can give them the token face up. The token can be used for a reroll and has to be then given back
	- can only have one token at a time
	- is lost at the end of the session


### Resting
This needs testing and tweaking for sure
- "Safe Havens" rule 
	- short rests - 8 hours of low activity 
	- long rest - 24 hours in a Safe Haven
		- A place is considered a safe haven if:
			- environment is not detrimental to PC's
			- PC's don't have to stay alert at all times
- "Gritty Realism"
	- short rests - 8 hours
	- long rests - 7 days
- fixes
	- Short rests restore long rest resources - proficiency bonus - short rests taken since last long rest
	- no full healing on long rests - just spending hit die
	- short rests 2 or 4 hours
	- Also instead of spending only hit dice on hit points they can also spend a hit die to gain half a long rest resource back a minimum of 1.
	    - Example a level 6 paladin could spend a hit die to get 15 points of lay on hands back   
	    - A level 6 barb can get 2 rages back.
	- potions of rest

### Exhaustion
- Each level of exhaustion adds am additive -1 to all tests for the character
- on reaching exhaustion 10, PC dies
- Long rest reduces exhaustion by 1


## Combat

### Initiative
- Side initiative - Initiative is rolled for each side of the conflicts and all members of the group can act interchangeably

### Bosses
- Bosses use charged attacks - video game style, where a powerful attack will be unleashed in a set number of turns unless players manage to stop the monster
- Bosses act between every player's turn
### Crits
- You can maximise one die before rolling a crit

### Damage Conditions
- Any creature below 1/2 HP is 'heavily wounded'
- Any creature below 1/5 HP is 'Bloodied' 

### Elevation
- Shooting from high ground hives +2 to hit
- Shooting from low ground, enemy counts as having half-cover

### Potions
- Drinking or administering a potion is a bonus action, taking a full action gives maximum roll

### Getting Downed
- gain a level of exhaustion
### Death Saves
- Death saves are rolled in secret
### Last Stand
- PC's can take an action right before they die, and said action can overcome their natural limits

## Exploring

### Traps
- Traps roll attack against front PC's perception, if they hit, PC doesn't notice and set's it off

## Equipment
