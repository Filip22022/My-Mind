## What is Second-order Thinking?

Second order thinking is a thought exercise and decision making tool helping to see the long term consequences of our actions.

While looking at the immediate consequences of decisions (first-order thinking) tells us what will happen when we make a decision, second-order impact is about the changes that decision will bring in the future.

### How to use it?

Two ways to examine the second-order impact:
- Asking "And then what?" - as many times as needed
- As time goes by 10 - consequences in 10 hours / days / weeks / months / years

## Examples

When examining a decision it can give us information we didn't think of before.

decision:  
	Starting another side project
first-order consequences: 
	having more tasks, being more tired, having another project on my resume
second-order impact:
- having more tasks -> coding longer hours -> less time for friends and family
- being more tired -> having less energy -> not focusing on college -> worse grades
- having another project on resume -> learning another technology -> feeling more confident in my skills -> easier time finding a job
