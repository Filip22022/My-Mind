My noes from the copywriting course on ContentWriter

## Choosing Text Type

To pick a type of content to use for different needs of a business we need to consider following factors:
- business objective (what outcome does the client want?)
- marketing resources (what content is featured on client's website?)
- finances (what text will be most lucrative for this project?)


## SEO

SEO writing is writing with the purpose of creating a text that the search engines can easily catalogue.

To write in a way that makes use of search algorithm we need to understand the key steps
1. **Keyword analysis** - through advanced language processing, the search engine takes into account the meaning, context , incorrect spelling, synonyms and time relevance of out query
2. **Matching results to query** - The engine looks for pages matching our query in the large library of data, by selecting the websites where the keywords we entered appear multiple times and in different contexts
3. **Page relevance ranking** - The results are ranked in order of predicted usefulness. The relevance is determined by many factors, such as text, formatting, and links leading to the site(sign of reliability and popularity)
4. **Filtering** - considering the location, search history, browser settings and preferences

The most important step of the process for content writers is the second one, as our task is to create text that is easily found.


### Keywords

Keywords - phrases that users input into the search engine to obtain results useful to them

SEO optimisation focuses on improving the positioning if the website in the 'natural' way, as opposed to Search Engine Marketing (priority paid display)

Longer queries provide search engine with more information, allowing it to return more specialised results

Long-tail keywords are phrases which specify additional information, consisting of three or more words
*Example:
	car - keyword
	red opel car - long-tail keyword*


### How to Determine Keywords
How to find out what keywords to use if the client didn't include it in assignment specification

1. Determine the subject of the text and target audience
2. Find out what people want to know
	- Using paid tools
		- Mangools
		- KWFinder
		- Keysearch
		- Ahrefs
	- Freemium tools 
		- AnswerThePublic
	- Free tools
		- GoogleKeywordPlanner
		- Google autocomplete
		- Google related searches
		- Google similar searches
3. Saturate the text - keywords should constitute 0.-3% of the text, but to rank well in search, we need to use other words in the same category in the text

## How to Write Texts

### Headings
Headings are important both for SEO, as that's where the keywords should importantly be placed, but also for readability and reader experience

Important practices about headings:
- Headings should always follow hierarchy (h1 followed by h2 and so on, not h1 followed by h3)
- There should always be text between different headings (headings shouldn't occupy two consecutive lines)

### Where to place Keywords
Keywords should be placed at the beginning and at the end of the text to introduce topic to the reader and then to remind them what they have just read.

Additionally it's very important to put keywords into the title (H1 heading), and most second-order (H2) headings.

Moreover an additional 2-3 keywords per paragraph (or 4-6 per page) is the amount we should be able to fit into the text.

It's also important to remember that the text should be stylistically natural, without being over-saturated with key phrases. We should use synonymous expressions and other ways of getting around repetition.

### Bullet Points
Clear enumeration is often recommended for texts written with SEO in mind, if it fits the 
text.


## Stylistic Rules
Copywriting and SEO Contentwriting is a kind of 'applied literature' which, different from literature made to entertain the reader is written to serve a clear practical purpose, and as such should use some stylistic devices with caution.

### Emotion Signs
Ellipsis(...), exclamation marks, question marks, and dashes (and possibly other) are signs that simulate communicative behaviours in text, and are very useful when that's the purpose of writing.

In utilitarian writing however it's better to avoid or limit the use of such devices, as the desired image we try to convey is most often that of reliability and professionalism.

Using them where appropriate can be done, especially question marks can often serve a purpose. If it's unnecessary however it's better to refrain from that. 

### Empty Adjectives
Exaggerating superlatives and empty adjectives are almost always counterproductive, and don't contribute to the quality and effectiveness of the text.

By calling a product "exceptional", "excellent" or "fantastic" we provide no real information to the reader, and they will know that. Instead we can provide facts and add credibility to our claims by writing what makes our product Y have the quality X.

### Stylistic Devices
While stylistic devices are important part of literature and poetry, they have no place in SEO writing, and must be avoided.

It's useful to learn about them to see if we have tendencies for any of them that we have to avoid.

And no dialogue.


## What to Add to a Text

### Links
Add only when asked to
#### External Links
Links to other websites, very important for SEO

#### Internal Links
Links to other sections of the same website. They serve to organise content and familiarise readers with present content.

#### SEO Importance
Links are essential for search engine positioning. External links are treated as verification of reliability of the page, while internal links signal organisation and proper structure of the website.

#### Anchors
Large number of crudely packed together links, or an ugly string of text that disrupts the rhythm and coherence of the text is not good for Google. Instead we should use anchor text.

types of anchor texts:
- URL (not the best linguistically)
- Slogan (e.g. if you want to know more, click here) (also not sophisticated)
- Name of the brand or product (worth linking to specific subpage)
- Key phrase (in an unaltered form)
- rephrased/similar meaning key phrase (best way, flows naturally, should also inform where will the link take the reader)

#### Don'ts
- Don't overuse
- two different anchors should not link to the same content
- Add hyperlinks when not asked to 
#### Do's
- Make anchors stylistically consistent with the text
- Be clear about what to expect from the linked page

### Formatting

#### Main Text

- Choose the right font
- choose alignment
- set the smallest spacing between the words
- set font size - suggested 11-12pts

#### Enumerations
Should be done using appropriate functions of text-editor, not by typing hyphens (unless it converts automatically)

#### Headings
- All the headings should have the same font
- Different headings should have different sizes
- Recommended formatting to the left
- Distance between headings and surrounding text should be identical for all headings

## How to Be a Good Content Writer

Qualities a good content writer needs:
- Being able to write well
- Being a flexible and quick learner
- Being able to organize work independently
- Having interpersonal skills

### Doing Research Properly

1. Check all information in at least two sources
		To avoid repeating other's mistakes or plagiarism. It's also a good idea to cite different points of view.
2. Use valuable sources
	- Filter results in search engine
	- Use authoritative sites with reputation in the industry
	- .edu domain is an indicator of quality 
	- Wikipedia is a good source, but not as an only source, and should be checked for credibility (author, footnotes, date of publishing)
3. Visit a library - use book sources
4. Don't be limited to first-page search
	- Look for less obvious and repeated information
	- Unique facts create impression of deeper knowledge
	- Enthusiast blogs are great for this

### Build a Professional Portfolio
- website or sub-page on your website
- text document

Traits of a good portfolio:
- Quality is everything - Clients won't read a lot of your portfolio, texts can be short but have to be good. Only include texts you're sure of
- Diversify content - include various topics and types of text. It's up to you to be a specialist or an all-rounder
- Create an interesting layout - clear, readable and aesthetically pleasing
- Include list of satisfied customers and links to finished content - with their permission. Only provide if you have a few already, to not draw attention to your inexperience.
- Include your introduction - include contact details if in text form. Can also include CV

### Target Your Texts
Adapt your text for a purpose. If no guidelines are given, create your own

- What is the text's purpose?
	- SEO text
	- building authority
	- subject-specific with advertisement
	- product description encouraging purchase 
- What image/vision do you want to sell? - Text must be consistent with brand image
	- How the client wants to be perceived? 
	- professional, expert or friendly, laid-back
	- luxury good or available and reasonably priced 
- What is the target audience?
	- Use language that would reach the target audience
	- you need to find a common language and area of understanding

### Language of Benefits
There's a specific way of shaping a language that works best in marketing, writing content and ads. It may feel unnatural at first, but with practice the use will become familiar.

Two rules of benefit language:
1. Focus on the benefit that a solution/service/product offers - golden rule "feature - advantage - benefit"
		When giving any information about a product, we want to emphasize the gain associated with it. "Vitamin C has antioxidant properties" -> "Vitamin C, thanks to it's antioxidant properties, acts as a shield against harmful environmental factors"
1. Don't use expressions suggesting uncertainty - 
		Content must be written from the point of view of  a person convinced about validity of their statements. Words like "sometimes", "trying", "maybe" weaken the message. 

### Capturing Readers Attention
Internet users spend only as much as a few seconds on an article page. They're looking for a specific information, and if your article doesn't **seem** to have it, they move on.

How to make sure your key information is accessible and easy to find?
- **Bold the important information** - that will be what the users actually read, highlight phrases and entire sentences
- **Place the main thesis in the title and headings** - they are the most visible, make them memorable and/or clear and precise about what will be in the paragraph
- **Strong introduction is important** - That will be the most read paragraph. It's a good idea to already include the most important information there.
- **Enhance the text visually** - Long paragraphs and walls of text look unappealing, add bullet points, enumerations, tables, infographics and photos(if part of your work)


### Understand Marketing
Most of content writing is connected to sales and advertisement, and as such marketing knowledge can be very useful. It's advised to get an interest in the area and read a bit on the basics and current trends. But even more importantly avoid the following most common mistakes:

- **Empty boasting** - statements not backed with specific information. It's better to list potential favourable outcomes, than unconvincing adjectives
- **Shouting** - Overusing CAPS, Exclamations!, and imperative mode. This will be perceived as pushy and aggressive
- **Blandness, lack of ideas** - Don't be afraid to be creative and original, your task is to capture attention in an imaginative way. Good content has a personal touch, without being controversial.

### Understand Psychology
Only by understanding people you will be able to write effective and usable content. Taking an interest in psychology will make you more influential and convincing. Areas that are useful for writers are **persuasion techniques** and **language theory**
