Implementation Intention is a plan about where, when and how to act. It's a technique that helps us follow through with our decisions and complete out plans, because [[Implementation is Better than Motivation]]

## Formula

The broadest formula for implementation intention would be:
=="In situation X, I will respond with Y"==

But at the core it's any concise plan that tells us what we want to do, and what are the triggers to do it. Other simple example is:
=="I will do {Behaviour} at {Time} in {Location}"==
