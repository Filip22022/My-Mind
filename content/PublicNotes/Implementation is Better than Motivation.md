Implementation - making specific and plans and triggers that ensure we will follow through with our plans

## Why is it Better
Motivation is an important aspect of life and productivity, but it's also unstable and cannot be relied on. Moreover a study[^1] cited by James Clear in [[Atomic habits]] when talking about [[Implementation Intention]] [^2], discovered that among two groups asked to build exercise habits, the one formulating concrete plans for the exercise achieved significantly better results than the one asked to use motivation.

While motivation can give us momentary power boost, it doesn't last long, and we rarely manage to use it. That's especially true if we don't have the kind of flexibility that would allow us to pursue whatever action we are currently motivated to do.

Implementation on the other hand is a reliable procedure, that is simple to follow, and we can ensure that it's trigger is set to an appropriate time and place.  By sticking to the intention, we can achieve stable performance and the desired outcome
