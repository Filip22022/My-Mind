This is a public part of my personal obsidian vault. I decided to publish it after getting to know the concept of [[Learning in Public]] as I wanted to give it a try.
It is also a way for me to face the fear of exposing myself and sharing anything online.

Here are some interesting things I have made notes about:
- [[Technology and Software]]
- [[Teaching Thursday]]
- [[Writing - Public | Writing]]
